### Update the apt package list.
```
sudo apt-get update -y
```

### Install Docker's package dependencies.
```
sudo apt-get install -y \
    apt-transport-https \
    ca-certificates \
    curl \
    software-properties-common
```

### Download and add Docker's official public PGP key.
```
curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo apt-key add -
```

### Verify the fingerprint.
```
sudo apt-key fingerprint 0EBFCD88
```

#### Add the `stable` channel's Docker upstream repository.
#### If you want to live on the edge, you can change "stable" below to "test" or "nightly". I highly recommend sticking with stable!
```
sudo add-apt-repository \
   "deb [arch=amd64] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu \
   $(lsb_release -cs) \
   stable"
```

### Update the apt package list (for the new apt repo).
```
sudo apt-get update -y
```

### Install the latest version of Docker CE.
```
sudo apt-get install -y docker-ce
```

### Allow your user to access the Docker CLI without needing root access.
```
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
```

### Install Docker Compose using PIP instead of the pre-compiled binary on GitHub because it runs a little bit faster (both are still Python apps).

### Install Python 3 and PIP.
```
sudo apt-get install -y python3 python3-pip
```

### Install Docker Compose into your user's home directory.
```
pip3 install --user docker-compose
```

#### The next step is to make sure $HOME/.local/bin is set on your WSL $PATH.

```
echo $PATH. Depending on what WSL distro you use, you may or may not see /home/nick/.local/bin (replace nick with your username)

If it’s not there, you’ll want to add it to your $PATH. You can do that by opening up your profile file with nano ~/.profile. Then anywhere in the file, on a new line, add export PATH="$PATH:$HOME/.local/bin" and save the file.
source ~/.profile 

```

### Connect to a remote Docker daemon with this 1 liner:
```
echo "export DOCKER_HOST=tcp://localhost:2375" >> ~/.bashrc && source ~/.bashrc
```

### You should get a bunch of output about your Docker daemon.
### If you get a permission denied error, close + open your terminal and try again.
```
docker info
```

### You should get back your Docker Compose version.
```
docker-compose --version
```

# Ensure Volume Mounts Work

### Create and modify the new WSL configuration file:
```
sudo nano /etc/wsl.conf
```

### Now make it look like this and save the file when you're done:
```
[automount]
root = /
options = "metadata"

We need to set root = / because this will make your drives mounted at /c or /e instead of /mnt/c or /mnt/e.
```
### Bind custom mount points to fix Docker for Windows and WSL differences:
```
sudo mkdir /c
sudo mount --bind /mnt/c /c
```
